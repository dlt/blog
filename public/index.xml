      <description>TLDR; This article is fruit of a bunch of notes I took in the last months while I read and watched everything I could put my hands on regarding indexes. I wanted to write about them because I wanted to make sure I got a good grasp of the theme, and it covers just the bare minimum knowledge of indexes a backend developer should know. If you want an in-depth discussion about indexes I suggest you to look at this amazing database agnostic resource put up by Markus Winand, or this series of blog posts by Egor Egorov.</description>
